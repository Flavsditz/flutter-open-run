# Flutter Open Run

The goal here is to create an Open Source Engine that can be used on different apps as the backbone for localization or running apps.
For that we want to have some goals such as:

- A good localization strategy with selectable parameters for the precision
- A good format to exchange information with other applications or components
  - Example: Map that shows the route travelled
  - Example: Component that exports the data to another format (GPX, CSV, etc)
- Precise (a.k.a. really good) way to measure the current speed
- Precise (a.k.a. really good) way to measure the distance traveled


##Contributing
Since this project is still very much raw I would like to have some open discussions, in the format of github issues, in order to define a direction together.
